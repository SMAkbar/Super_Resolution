# Super_Resolution
Implementing state-of-the-art GAN techniques to achieve Super Resolution


~With the aim to implement the state-of-the-art architecture and techinques to acheive the achieve the Super Resolution

~With hope to improve improve the resolution of my 5 years old Samsung S4 that I already had bought a used back in 2015

------ I have started working on this project and hopes that will benefits the open source community -------

-------------------- Plan layout --------------------
=====================================================

1) Try to know what to find --> Start Surfing!!!
2) Do a bit of literature overview
3) List down different techniques and drive a timeline
4) Validate the drived timeline from a paper review
5) Implement Basic GAN architecture


/****** Current step of the plan ******/
6) Implement ResNet with(out) Keras
/*************  End *******************/

7) Improve Generator architecture
8) Improve Discrenubator architecture
9) Improve loss function
