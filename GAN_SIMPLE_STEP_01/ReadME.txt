~With the aim to implement the state-of-the-art architecture and techinques to acheive the achieve the Super Resolution

~With hope to improve improve the resolution of my 5 years old Samsung S4 that I already had bought a used back in 2015

------ I have started working on this project and hopes that will benefits the open source community -------

=====================================================
-------------------- Plan layout --------------------
=====================================================

1) Try to know what to find --> Start Surfing!!!
2) Do a bit of literature overview
3) List down different techniques and drive a timeline
4) Validate the drived timeline from a paper review


/****** Current step of the plan ******/

5) Implement Basic GAN architecture
	
	a) Implementing GAN with Tensorflow
	b) Implementing GAN with Tensorflow in Keras

/*************  End *******************/

6) Improve Generator architecture
7) Improve Discrenubator architecture
8) Improve loss function

Let's start....
